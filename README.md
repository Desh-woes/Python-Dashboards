# Introduction
Welcome to this repository. The entire purpose of the repo is to document my learnings and build my skills with regards to dashboard applications in Python. In this repository, I will be working with the Python Library called Dash and there are further instructions below to help you get started with the project as well.

## Dependencies
- Dash: [https://dash.plot.ly/installation](https://dash.plot.ly/installation)

## Installation
Granted that you have Python installed on your system, you can easily install the missing dependencies using pip as shown below
> pip install dash==1.0.2  # The core dash backend
> pip install dash-daq==0.1.0  # DAQ components (newly open-sourced!)

### Dash Usages
Dash is a framework for building analytical web applications in python.

### Credits
Most of the projects implemented have been adapted from the Dash tutorial document which can be found [here](https://dash.plot.ly/)
